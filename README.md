TODO:
	- Add Fuel layout code (make buttons purchase X amount)
	- Add Sell layout code (display all items in inventory. sell items according to their value)
	- Add Upgrade layout code
	- Add drill to player
	
Nice to do:
	- Replace inventory with resource
	
Ideas:
	- Add time limit and have to pay X amount every week to a debt
		- Lose if can't pay
